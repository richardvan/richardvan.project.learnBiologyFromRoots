been working a lot on this project, a couple good days off school so focused deep in this. Initially overkilled the project by trying to use google Sheets, currently switched back to basic arrays and objects built in javascript.  As of last night got the tool to do a basic operation of testing for substring against a dictionary

#### the dictionary problem (spawned off setup project)
using "Dictionary of Word Roots and Combining Forms" written in the 1960s, it's a really good reference and I think all the roots probably hold true up until modern day (word roots are essentially roots by definition which means they stay as a firm foundation).  It's been hard trying to parse the entire dictionary into a text file, simple copy and paste over .pdf text isn't 100% accurate with any OCR program.  There are a couple professional versions but with zero budget it's probably better if I just type it (sarcasm, extreme case, will take forever!) so I will need to figure out something in between.  The PDF I got I can copy and paste over a good 70%+ and that's being very conservative, it's more like 85%+.

The goal will be to have a stable dictionary to look up roots against. I figure I will use this root finder for the foreseeable future and one day even pass it onto other people.

started this project, figured it would be helpful to synthesis knowledge in a couple areas to create a tool that would be beneficial to the community moving forward.  Found a good dictionary (hard part) from an old book called "DICTIONARY of WORD ROOTS and COMBINING FORMS" b Donald J. Borror

Many todos thought of:
- clean up the dictionary
- get a most recent 5 up
- look up roots
