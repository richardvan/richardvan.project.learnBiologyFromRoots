### 2016-10-27
started this project, figured it would be helpful to synthesis knowledge in a couple areas to create a tool that would be beneficial to the community moving forward.  Found a good dictionary (hard part) from an old book called "DICTIONARY of WORD ROOTS and COMBINING FORMS" b Donald J. Borror

Many todos thought of:
- clean up the dictionary
- get a most recent 5 up
- look up roots
